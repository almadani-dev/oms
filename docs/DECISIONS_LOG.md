### Decision
Trial Balance Phase 1 requires a single `currency_id` filter and never blends totals across currencies. If no currency is flagged `is_base`, the page falls back to the first currency by id rather than leaving the field blank. Per-row مدين/دائن balance stays plain text (uncolored); green/red is reserved exclusively for the overall حالة الميزان (متوازن/غير متوازن) badge.

### Reason
Audit traced `transaction_lines.debit_base`/`credit_base` write paths and found they always hold the line's own-currency amount, never a true company-base-currency conversion (even when `fx_rate != 1`). Summing them across accounts in different currencies would produce a meaningless blended total and a misleading balance verdict. The uncolored-row / colored-summary-badge split keeps "this account is in debit" visually distinct from "the ledger doesn't balance."

### Impact
No blended cross-currency Trial Balance is possible in Phase 1 — users must pick a currency to view its accounts. Opening/closing balance and exports deferred to later phases.
